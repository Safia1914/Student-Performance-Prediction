# Student-Performance-Prediction
Exploratory data analysis and regression modeling (Linear &amp; Polynomial) on student performance dataset to predict academic outcomes.
# Student Performance Prediction 🎓📊

This project uses regression analysis to predict student grades based on various features like sleep time, participation, and more.

## 📌 Features
- Data cleaning and EDA
- Correlation heatmap
- Linear Regression & Polynomial Regression
- Model performance comparison
- Bonus: Experiment with different feature combinations

## 🚀 Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset includes variables like hours of sleep, class participation, and actual grades.

## 📊 Results
Polynomial regression slightly outperforms linear regression when using non-linear features like sleep x participation.

## 🔗 How to Run
1. Clone the repo
2. Install requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab
